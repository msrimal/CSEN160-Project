                    HEARTATTACK GAME - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
HeartAttack is an educational tower defense game built in Java that combines
strategic gameplay with heart biology quiz questions. Players defend a heart
organ from waves of viruses by using specific weapons to eliminate different
virus types, while answering quiz questions that appear at random intervals.
The game features progressive difficulty, visual effects, and a comprehensive
user interface.

HOW WE BUILT THIS PROJECT
================================================================================

1. PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Organized as a standard Java Gradle project
   - Package structure: com.maya_steph.virusdefense
   - Separated concerns into distinct classes for maintainability

2. DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
   - Object-oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities
   - Game loop architecture using Java Swing Timer for 60 FPS rendering
   - Event-driven input handling with KeyListener interface
   - State management for game phases (home screen, gameplay, quiz, game over)

3. BUILD PROCESS
   - Used Gradle as the build automation tool
   - Configured Java 11 compatibility
   - Set up application plugin for easy execution
   - Included JUnit 5 for testing framework
   - Created custom Gradle tasks for running the game

4. CORE COMPONENTS DEVELOPMENT
   - GamePanel: Main game loop, rendering, and input handling
   - Player: Player movement and positioning logic
   - Virus: Virus types, movement, health, and collision detection
   - Weapons: Weapon system with projectiles and collision mechanics
   - QuizManager: JSON-based question loading and random selection
   - RoundManager: Progressive difficulty and round progression
   - OverlayEffect: Visual effects (shakes, flashes, overlays)
   - SoundManager: Audio system for sound effects

5. DATA MANAGEMENT

     * Spiky Ball (Key 1) - Effective against Spiky viruses
     * Ball (Key 2) - Effective against Round viruses
     * Star (Key 3) - Effective against Star viruses
     * Arrow (Key 4) - Effective against Arrow viruses
   - Projectile Physics: Weapons shoot upward from player position
   - Weapon Switching: Direct key selection (1-4) or cycling (P key)
   - Effectiveness Check: Only matching weapons damage viruses

4. QUIZ SYSTEM
